Design of a bank based on SOLID principles.

The project proposal is to refactor the previous project of a simple Bank application and its basic functionalities, namely: deposit, withdraw, last transaction and balance. As the project was based on SOLID principles, all classes have a single purpose, can be extended but not modified and maintain a good level of abstraction and decoupling.
